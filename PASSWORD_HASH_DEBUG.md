# üîß Password Hash Error Analysis

## üö® Issue: Invalid Password Hash Error

**Error**: `[Error [BetterAuthError]: Invalid password hash]`

## üîç Analysis of Your Logs

Looking at your authentication logs:

```
‚úÖ POST 200 /api/auth/sign-in/social  (GitHub OAuth - WORKING)
‚úÖ POST 200 /api/auth/sign-in/email   (Some email logins - WORKING)
‚ùå POST 500 /api/auth/sign-in/email   (Some email logins - FAILING)
```

## üïµÔ∏è Root Cause Analysis

The mixed success/failure pattern suggests:

### 1. **OAuth Users vs Email Users**
- **GitHub OAuth**: Working perfectly (no passwords involved)
- **Email/Password**: Mixed results - some work, some don't

### 2. **Possible Causes**
1. **Database Migration Issues**: 
   - Old SQLite password hashes incompatible with MySQL
   - Password format changed during migration

2. **Better Auth Password Handling**:
   - Better Auth expects specific password hash format
   - Our custom password reset route might be creating incompatible hashes

3. **User Account Types**:
   - Some users created via OAuth (no password)
   - Some users created via email/password
   - Mixed account types causing validation issues

## üîç What's Likely Happening

### Scenario A: Database Migration Issue
- Users created in SQLite have password hashes in one format
- MySQL migration didn't preserve hash compatibility
- Better Auth can't validate old password hashes

### Scenario B: Custom Password Hashing Conflict
- Our reset password route uses `bcryptjs` with 12 rounds
- Better Auth might use different hashing or rounds
- Hash format mismatch causing validation failures

### Scenario C: Account Type Confusion
- User tries to login with email/password
- But their account was created via OAuth (no password set)
- Better Auth throws "Invalid password hash" for missing passwords

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Solutions

### 1. **Let Better Auth Handle All Password Operations**
Remove custom password hashing from reset password route:

```typescript
// REMOVE THIS (custom hashing):
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);

// USE Better Auth's built-in password update instead
```

### 2. **Check Account Types Before Login**
Add validation to ensure user has email/password account:

```typescript
// Check if user has credential account before attempting login
const hasCredentialAccount = await checkUserAccountType(email);
if (!hasCredentialAccount) {
  return "This email is associated with OAuth login only";
}
```

### 3. **Database Password Hash Audit**
Check existing password hashes in database:
- Are they in expected format?
- Are there null/empty password fields?
- Do hash lengths match expected format?

## üß™ Debug Steps

### 1. **Check User Account Types**
In database, run:
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  a.provider,
  a.\`providerId\`,
  LENGTH(a.password) as password_length,
  a.password IS NOT NULL as has_password
FROM \`user\` u
LEFT JOIN account a ON a.\`userId\` = u.id
WHERE u.email = 'failing-user@example.com';
```

### 2. **Verify Password Hash Format**
Check if password hashes start with expected bcrypt format:
- Should start with `$2a$`, `$2b$`, or `$2y$`
- Should be ~60 characters long

### 3. **Test Different User Types**
- Try login with known OAuth-only user
- Try login with known email/password user
- Compare error messages

## üöÄ Recommended Fix

**Phase 1: Immediate**
1. Remove custom password hashing from reset route
2. Use Better Auth's built-in password update methods
3. Add account type validation before login attempts

**Phase 2: Database Cleanup**
1. Audit existing password hashes
2. Migrate incompatible hashes if needed
3. Clean up orphaned accounts

The mixed success pattern strongly suggests this is a data consistency issue rather than a code bug.
